TODO:
- JobExecutor process a list of jobs (instead of one job a time)
- JobExecutor picks the best service per job
- IService has method: Best Shape to Execute with (utilize this method in ServiceFactory)
- Use LINQ to condense some of the code (especially in ServiceFactory, look into MaxBy)
- Try a switch expression to get the service based on the counter
- Make a new shape (ex: Triangle)
